# Systematic deep transfer learning
## Idea
This code contains a systematic deep transfer learning method based on a small dataset to detect defects of the spaghetti-shape error in the FDM process. First, images for training and validation are augmented effectively by considering a variation in part shape and visual monitoring conditions. Second, the feature extractors are divided into multiple training sections to evaluate various fine-tuning strategies systematically.
