## FDM process image dataset with spaghetti-shape errors for defection detection

## Summary
In this repository, an FDM process image dataset is prepared with normal and defective cases (spaghetti-shape errors) images of various part shapes and colors collected from an in-house laboratory and Google Image Search to involve multiple printing conditions.

1. Dataset - FDM Image Dataset, including the spaghetti-shape error as defective
